This announcement follows the Food and Drug Administration's final approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which had previously been authorized for emergency use. The move by Delta Air Lines comes as employers are trying to increase the rate of COVID-19 vaccination among their workers, with some employers mandating vaccination and others considering insurance surcharges on unvaccinated workers to cover increased health care costs from hospital bills incurred by infected workers. Delta Air Lines appears to be the first major employer to publicly implement a surcharge. The surcharge will be applied starting November 1 to unvaccinated workers on Delta's insurance plan.\n",

Employees are required to take Covid tests twice a week. In the second stage, Salesforce will operate from 20% to 75% capacity based on the company's assessed risk, and employees can return even if they have not received a vaccine. The final stage brings offices up to 100% capacity. Salesforce has also been busy remodeling its offices, adding Plexiglas, air purifiers, and handles that people can use without touching.\n",
